# SnapShot

Problem: To train a model, large quantities of input is needed.

Proposed Solution: Use IoT triggers to collect data for modeling.

Sample Use Case: We'd like to be able to use machine learning to tell if a basketball shot was successful. We'll use an IR sensor to determine successful shots.
